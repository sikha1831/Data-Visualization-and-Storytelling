his visual report analyzes US regional sales data from the provided CSV dataset, focusing on key business metrics like revenue, profit, order trends, and channel performance.

Using Power BI, I created an interactive dashboard to tell the story of sales performance: In-Store channels drive the highest revenue but Wholesale offers the highest margins despite lower volumes; NMK warehouse dominates operations, suggesting opportunities for optimization in underperforming channels like Wholesale.
